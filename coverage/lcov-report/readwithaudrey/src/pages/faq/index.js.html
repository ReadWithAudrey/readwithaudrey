      &lt;h1 className="f2 pink tc montserrat mb3 mt4"&gt;FAQs&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2 className="f3 pink tc montserrat mb3"&gt;What to expect&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        The Audrey experience comprises of five separate ten minute reading
        sessions. We choose a surprise book for you and divide it into 5
        chapters to correspond with the five reading sessions. There’s a real
        mix of how regularly community members meet to read together. Some
        reading partners do one regular session each week, and therefore read
        the book over the course of about a month. Others read together over
        consecutive evenings and complete the book within a week. It’s really up
        to you and your reading partner. What we do encourage is that you only
        read one chapter during each session – even if it’s tempting to read on.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        Our community spend about ten minutes reading together, and then
        anything from just a couple of minutes right up to an hour chatting.
        This usually starts with a conversation about the text, and moves on to
        wider topics covering almost anything.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        Most people feedback and tell us that the intimacy of reading together
        helps them to feel at ease with their partner and allows them to build a
        deep and meaningful social connection together. Almost everyone who
        tries Audrey feeds back saying the experience helps them to feel
        relaxed. Our community often find themselves engaged in conversations
        with their reading partner that they might not usually have with the
        people in their day to day lives.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;h2 className="f3 pink tc montserrat mb3"&gt;Before the reading sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        People can choose to be either the reader or listener, or have a go at
        both.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        It’s highly unlikely you’ll know the person you are partnered with, but
        we’ve attempted to pair readers and listeners who we think will connect
        well and enjoy each other’s company.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        We will introduce you to each other over email. We’ll share bios,
        provide contact details, and assist with arranging a time for the first
        reading session. We will provide details about the book you’ll be
        reading, so that you both have an idea of what to expect before the
        reading session.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        We will make sure you both receive a copy of the book (usually in a
        digital format) before the first reading session. This is usually
        attached to the email when we introduce you to your reading partner.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;h2 className="f3 pink tc montserrat mb3"&gt;The reading sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        You only need a spare 10 minutes to have a reading session. We think
        Mondays are the best day to start reading sessions. In fact we think
        Mondays are the best day for all reading sessions. We gently encourage
        this habit within the Audrey community. Monday&amp;apos;s Audrey Day!
        It&amp;apos;s helpful for many, but it&amp;apos;s not practical for everyone.
        Therefore we suggest Tuesdays as back up. If this isn’t possible either,
        then we kick you out.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        Reading sessions can take place over the phone (audio only) or you can
        use a messaging app (e.g. Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger or Apple
        Facetime) where you’ll have access to audio and video. You can decide
        this with your reading partner once you’ve been introduced over email.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        For each session you can expect the reading to take 10 minutes.
        Afterwards you’re welcome to open up conversations about the reading,
        but this is entirely up to you. There’s complete flexibility here - some
        users chat for a couple of minutes, some for up to an hour... some only
        talk about their thoughts on the book ... others dive into topics
        loosely connected to the story... often users end up talking about
        topics completely unrelated to the book.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        Don’t forget to agree the time for your next session before you say
        goodbye.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;h2 className="f4 pink tc montserrat mb3"&gt;After the reading sessions&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        We hope that the experience is mutually enjoyable and the book
        interesting and thought-provoking. It would be great to receive some
        feedback. Positives and negatives. Anything you enjoyed or did not enjoy
        about it. Ways that we could improve the experience etc.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;
        If you want to read another book, either with the same person, or
        someone else, please let us know. We’ll be delighted to organise this
        for you.
      &lt;/TextBox&gt;
&nbsp;
      &lt;TextBox&gt;Any questions, please get in touch.&lt;/TextBox&gt;
    &lt;/Layout&gt;
