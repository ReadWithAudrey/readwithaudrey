heading: 'Nearly there…'
description: 'Please tell us about yourself in up to 100 words. We’ll use your story (bio) to match you up with a reading partner. We’ll also use it when we introduce you to your reading partner.'
q1: 'Your Story'
q1Placeholder: 'Hi, I’m Rob. Away from work I love to spend time outdoors – long walks work wonders for my soul! I’m in my element sitting around a campfire with family, baking in our kitchen, or reading to my kids just before bed. I’m keen to read with someone outside my circle to open my eyes to different cultural perspectives. I’m not the most confident reader in the world so it would be great to have some practice!'
q2: "Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?"
q2Placeholder: 'Nothing I can think of - looking forward to it!'
tips: 'Tips: The most effective matches tend to happen when members share bios that are open and interesting, share a touch of quirkiness, and feel light-hearted in spirit. Consider describing the things you’re passionate about. It’s helpful to share your interests and what you do in your spare time. Try to avoid overused phrases e.g. easy-going. Instead, consider what makes you special ☺'
