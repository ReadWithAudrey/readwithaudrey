"The reading sessions are getting longer each week because we find that there's so much to talk about!" - Cristina, Sao Paulo.

"I like the fact that I can talk about the book with a person that I don't know - I can be honest and don't feel like I need to impress anyone." - Shreya, Bangalore.

"You’re not only discovering new books, you’re having a chance to look at the book from a completely different perspective." - Matt, London.

"I loved my experience with Sara and I think she would agree that we’ve bonded in a very strong way. We’ve kept in touch." - Maria, Mexico City.

"Things are going great and I am enjoying the reading sessions. I think we will be ready this week for book #3 if you can believe it!" - Stefanie, Chicago.
