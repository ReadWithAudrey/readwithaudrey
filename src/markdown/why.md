Audrey is a space where people from all walks of life can meet online and read thought-provoking books aloud together to spark interesting conversations and build meaningful relationships. Reading aloud together is a relaxing, soulful, shared experience where you quickly develop a real sense of connectedness with someone else. You feel nourished with an invigorated state of mind. Reading aloud together moves us to talk about our own stories and emotions. This helps to remind us how much we have in common which encourages connection and compassion. Reading aloud together exposes us to new ideas, enables us to see the world through the eyes of others, and teaches us the value of listening. The simplest experiences can inspire us, help us to focus on what's important to us, and make a meaningful difference in our everyday lives.
