description: 'Please tell us about yourself in up to 100 words. We’ll use your story (bio) to match you up with a reading partner. We’ll also use it when we introduce you to your reading partner.'
q1: 'Your Story'
q1Placeholder: 'About You'
q2: "Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?"

tips: 'Tips: The most effective matches tend to happen when members share bios that are open and interesting, share a touch of quirkiness, and feel light-hearted in spirit. Consider describing the things you’re passionate about. It’s helpful to share your interests and what you do in your spare time. Try to avoid overused phrases e.g. easy-going. Instead, consider what makes you special ☺'
