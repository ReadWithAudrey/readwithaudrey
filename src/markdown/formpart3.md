  Please tell us about yourself in up to 100 words. We’ll use your story (bio)
  to match you up with a reading partner. We’ll also use it when we introduce
  you to your reading partner.
q1: Your Story
q1Placeholder: >-
  Hi, I’m Rob. Away from work I love to spend time outdoors – long walks work
  wonders for my soul! I’m in my element sitting around a campfire with family,
  baking in our kitchen, or reading to my kids just before bed. I’m keen to read
  with someone outside my circle to open my eyes to different cultural
  perspectives. I’m not the most confident reader in the world so it would be
  great to have some practice!
q2: Is there anything else you'd like to tell us?
q2Placeholder: Nothing I can think of - looking forward to it!

  Tips: The most effective pairings tend to happen when you’re open and share
  something interesting and light-hearted about yourself. Describe what you like
  to do in your spare time, and perhaps share a touch of quirkiness. Consider
  what you’re passionate about and what makes you special ☺
